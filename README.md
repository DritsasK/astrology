# Astrology Gemini Client

Astrology is a minimalist, ncurses-based gemini client with simplicity in mind. The name pays tribute to the SCIENCE of Astrology which the current world order is actively trying to silence and humiliate. I hope that this project spreads some sort of awareness. It doesn't take a genius to realize that the gravitational pull of celestial bodies located light years away from us can influence our behaviour! Wake up sheeple!!1!

Some features, such as TOFU certificates are still missings. You can configurate the application by modifying `config.h` (compiling from source is incredibly fast). You can disable certificate validation too, if you're fine with that!
